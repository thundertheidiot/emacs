* GNU/Emacs

My personal GNU/Emacs configuration finally extracted from my NixOS flake. This is packaged with Nix using [[https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay][nix-community/emacs-overlay]]. You can find the package derivation in [[file:nix/package.nix][package.nix]].

I am using evil for vim keybindings, my custom binds are space focused, somewhat inspired by doom emacs.

There is also a home-manager module that sets up the emacs daemon, adds some required packages and links the early init file to =~/.config/emacs=.

You can try the configuration out using nix:
#+begin_src shell
nix run github:thundertheidiot/emacs#emacs
#+end_src

** Notes

I mostly use emacs as a server, so it's benefitial to not defer loading, since startup time is mostly unimportant. Most of the ~use-package~ definitions are optimized for deferring because I didn't know what I was doing, they will slowly change over time.
